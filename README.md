# FiStack
(Decentralised Brex , Xero, Quickbooks)

Problem:
===========

Managing the payroll expenses on a centralized system is always risky. 
1. Single point of control.
2. Single point of failure. 
2. Settling/reconciling the accounts very difficult. 
3. Auditing process is very time-consuming. 
4. Lots of manual work involved in HR, Manager, Accountant part. 


Solution
===========
A humble attempt to build a decentralized unified platform where one can manage the database of the employee as well as automate their payment. At FiStack you can

1. Enter the details about your employees.
2. Assign the role and manager.
3. Put the payment.
4. Automate the payment on an hourly/weekly/daily/monthly basis through using tokens.


## Challenges I ran into
Understand the new programming language. Understanding new language always requires some effort, but for clarity, it was a bit easy.
It would be great if we have some demo on how to connect with low code platform with our clarity code so that a backend developer can build a complete application.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Learning clarity
Learning Blockstack architecture. 
Deploying clarity dapp
Building dapp which was expected.


## What I learned
Tons of things from clarity to blockstack.

## What's next for FiStack
This hackathon gave a fair amount of exposure to learning clarity and architecture of Blockstack. Since time duration was short and learning was a lot. Some functionality will be finished in the next stage like automating the payment with token. The current version is a decentralized version of Xero/QuickBooks (payroll), after including the recurring payment feature it would be a decentralized version of Brex.
