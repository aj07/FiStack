# FiStack
(Decentralised Brex , Xero, Quickbooks)

Problem:
===========

Managing the payroll expenses on a centralized system is always risky. 
1. Single point of control.
2. Single point of failure. 
2. Settling/reconciling the accounts very difficult. 
3. Auditing process is very time-consuming. 
4. Lots of manual work involved in HR, Manager, Accountant part. 


Solution
===========
A humble attempt to build a decentralized unified platform where one can manage the database of the employee as well as automate their payment. At FiStack you can

1. Enter the details about your employees.
2. Assign the role and manager.
3. Put the payment.
4. Automate the payment on an hourly/weekly/daily/monthly basis through using tokens.
